## Datapack Features

- Automatically teleports you to the nether.  
- Gives you a kit with all the items you need to get the Advancement.  
  - Tools are all unbreakable.
- Adds a Retry Totem so you can practice endlessly on the same world.  
  - Teleports you far away (to avoid portal-linking).
  - Refills your stackable items. 
  - Gives you back Tools only if you lose them.
  - Revokes the Advancement so you can practice more.
