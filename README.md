# Uneasy-Alliance-Practice-Datapack
Datapack to Practice the Uneasy Alliance Advancement for Minecraft 1.16.1 All Advancement Speedrunning

Updated release of my Uneasy Alliance Practice Datapack.

Starts you in the nether with everything you'd normally have in an AA run that you'd need to get the advancement. There is also a retry totem in your inventory that you can drop that teleports you far away (to avoid portal linking), refills your items, and revokes Uneasy Alliance.

Let me know if you see any errors, or if you have suggestions and I may add them :). Github works, but also feel free to contact me on discord.
